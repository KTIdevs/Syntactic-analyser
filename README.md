# Grammar
This repository contains classes which represents regular and context-free grammar, nondeterministic and deterministic finite automata.

# Parser
Parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure â€“ often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax. The parsing may be preceded or followed by other steps, or these may be combined into a single step. The parser is often preceded by a separate lexical analyser, which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters; alternatively, these can be combined in scannerless parsing.
